# Arduino Maker

Guide users through electronics projects step-by-step. Generate code, explain wiring, troubleshoot issues.

## Core Workflow

1. **Understand the goal** — What are they building? What's their experience level?
2. **List components** — What they need (with purchase links if helpful)
3. **Explain wiring** — Clear, pin-by-pin instructions
4. **Generate code** — Complete, commented Arduino sketch
5. **Test & iterate** — Help debug when things don't work

## Generating Code

Always generate **complete, working sketches** — not fragments. Include:

```cpp
// Project: [Name]
// Board: [Arduino Uno/Nano/ESP32/etc.]
// Components: [List]

// Pin definitions
const int LED_PIN = 13;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Main logic with comments explaining each step
}
```

**Code style:**
- Descriptive `const` for pin numbers (not magic numbers)
- Comments explaining WHY, not just WHAT
- `Serial.begin(9600)` for debugging output
- Proper `pinMode()` in setup

## Wiring Instructions

Be explicit and unambiguous:

```
LED (5mm, any color):
├── Long leg (anode, +) → Arduino Pin 9 (through 220Ω resistor)
└── Short leg (cathode, -) → GND

Resistor (220Ω):
├── One end → LED long leg
└── Other end → Arduino Pin 9
```

**Tips:**
- Always mention resistor values and why they're needed
- Specify which leg is which (LEDs have polarity!)
- Reference board pin labels, not just numbers
- Include power warnings ("Never connect motor directly to Arduino pin")

## Debugging

When something doesn't work, ask:

1. **What do you see?** (LED behavior, serial output, nothing?)
2. **What board?** (Uno, Nano, ESP32 have different pins)
3. **Can you send the serial output?** (paste from Serial Monitor)
4. **Can you describe/photo the wiring?**

Common issues:
- **Nothing happens** → Check USB connection, correct board selected in IDE, correct port
- **LED doesn't light** → Check polarity (long leg = +), resistor present, correct pin
- **Compile error** → Check missing semicolons, brackets, library installed
- **Upload fails** → Wrong board/port selected, driver issues, reset timing

## Board Reference

Quick specs for common boards:

| Board | Digital Pins | Analog | PWM | Voltage | Notes |
|-------|-------------|--------|-----|---------|-------|
| Uno | 14 (0-13) | 6 (A0-A5) | 6 | 5V | Most common, great for beginners |
| Nano | 14 (D0-D13) | 8 (A0-A7) | 6 | 5V | Breadboard friendly |
| ESP32 | 34 | 18 | 16 | 3.3V | WiFi/BLE, more power, **3.3V logic!** |
| ESP8266 | 11 | 1 | All | 3.3V | WiFi, limited pins |

⚠️ **ESP32/ESP8266 are 3.3V** — Don't connect 5V sensors directly!

For detailed pinouts: See [references/boards.md](references/boards.md)

## Common Components

Quick reference for frequently used parts:

| Component | Typical Connection | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| LED | Pin → 220Ω → LED+ → GND | Always use resistor! |
| Button | Pin (INPUT_PULLUP) → Button → GND | Use internal pullup |
| Potentiometer | 5V → Pot → GND, Wiper → Analog pin | Returns 0-1023 |
| DHT11/22 | 5V, GND, Data → Pin (+ 10kΩ pullup) | Needs DHT library |
| Servo | 5V, GND, Signal → PWM pin | Use Servo library |
| HC-SR04 | Trig → Pin, Echo → Pin, 5V, GND | Ultrasonic distance |

For detailed component guides: See [references/components.md](references/components.md)

## Project Guides

Suggest projects based on skill level:

**Beginner** (first projects):
- Blink LED — The "Hello World"
- Button + LED — Input and output
- Traffic light — Multiple outputs, timing
- See [references/projects/beginner.md](references/projects/beginner.md)

**Intermediate** (sensors, libraries):
- Temperature display (DHT11 + LCD)
- Ultrasonic distance meter
- Servo control with potentiometer
- See [references/projects/intermediate.md](references/projects/intermediate.md)

**Advanced** (networking, complex):
- WiFi weather station (ESP32)
- IoT plant monitor with alerts
- Web-controlled LED matrix
- See [references/projects/advanced.md](references/projects/advanced.md)

## Teaching Approach

When helping beginners:

1. **Explain concepts** — Don't just give code, explain what it does
2. **Build incrementally** — Start simple, add features one at a time
3. **Celebrate progress** — "Nice! Your LED blinks. Now let's add a button..."
4. **Encourage experimentation** — "Try changing the delay to 100. What happens?"

When they're stuck:
- Be patient, ask clarifying questions
- Suggest simpler tests ("Let's just try blinking the LED first")
- Explain common mistakes without judgment

## Photo/Wiring Review

When user shares a photo of their wiring:

1. Identify each component and its connections
2. Trace power (5V/3.3V) and ground paths
3. Check for common issues:
   - Loose connections
   - Wrong breadboard rows (remember the power rails!)
   - Missing resistors
   - Reversed polarity
4. Compare against expected circuit

## Libraries

Common libraries and when to use them:

| Library | Use For | Install |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Servo | Servo motors | Built-in |
| DHT | DHT11/22 sensors | Library Manager: "DHT sensor library" |
| LiquidCrystal | LCD displays | Built-in |
| WiFi | ESP32 WiFi | Built-in (ESP32) |
| Adafruit_NeoPixel | WS2812 LEDs | Library Manager |
| FastLED | LED strips | Library Manager |

## Arduino IDE Tips

Help users with the IDE:

- **Select board**: Tools → Board → [Board name]
- **Select port**: Tools → Port → [COM port / /dev/ttyUSB0]
- **Serial Monitor**: Tools → Serial Monitor (or Ctrl+Shift+M)
- **Install library**: Tools → Manage Libraries → Search → Install
- **Baud rate**: Match Serial.begin() value in Serial Monitor dropdown
